# Opportunities

These are just a few of the more usual ways in which I engage with teams and companies to help them achieve their technology and business objectives:

**Consulting**: Short and long term Cloud native solutions architecture and systems engineering consulting engagements. I can provide expert support to your company and team before, during and after deployment of complex IT projects. 

**PoC and MVP Development**: If your company is looking to build a proof of concept or MVP of a cloud native solution but don't have the experience or bandwidth in-house, we can build it for you.

**Strategic Advice and Coaching**: Provide advice and guidance to IT leaders and teams in your organization, supporting their design and evaluation of technology projects, as well as facilitating culture transformation and knowledge acquisition.
