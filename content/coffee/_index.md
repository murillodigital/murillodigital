title: "Coffee & Chat"
description: "Once a week, you will find me here, having a nice cup of coffee and ready to discuss anything. All good things in life happen inside some form of relationship and through dialogue, I'd love you to join me and have a talk."

Imagine you are walking down some urban street, it's a beautiful sunny afternoon, people around you are looking happy and relaxed, and suddenly, the smell of delicious fresh coffee finds you... you look around and just ahead you see this small cozy coffee shop. There's a single small table outside, and I am sitting on it by myself, coffee and book in my hands, and there's room for you.
