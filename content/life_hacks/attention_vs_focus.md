I think people dont usually understand the real meaning of focus in one's life. They work intensely for three hours on something and call themselves focused, but true focus is not a 3 hour thing, focus is an infinite drive towards a clear target that lasts days, weeks, months and years - that overpowers any distraction, that keeps going on your good days and your bad days, that dawns light onto confusion, and keeps you on track.

People confuse attention with focus, you can pay attention for 3 hours.
