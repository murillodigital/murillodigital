As you all likely have noticed, I've been very much focused in habit building and "self-reprogramming" recently, after having read [The Power of Habit]({{< ref power_of_habit.md >}}).

As you can read in the post I linked above, one of the key components to successfully establishing a habit is a clear reward, one that you can build up to actually anticipate the instant you get the cue that triggers the routine.

Music is one of those passions that has been a part of my life since I was a kid, it has always been an element of most of my memories and perhaps the artistic expression that I can more viscerally experience.

I was riding my bike the other day on my [daily 30 minute ride]({{< ref 96_period_day.md >}}) and this song started to play, and all of a sudden, the experience became surreal, I realized the beauty of that very moment, I felt connected to the people around me, I felt everything more intensely. And right then I thought: **that was my reward**, an experience so pleasurable that I could focus on and anticipate every day.

Right then it hit me, **it all started with a song**! Something that had a name, and that I can elicit on demand with a single touch! That was a very powerful realization.

Since then, I've started to become conscious of those songs that trigger those deep emotions, and I've begun integrating them at key moments in my routines while being intensely focused on internalizing the experience, and the results, so far, are looking very promising.

Music is a powerful tool! Go ahead and try it out and tell me your experience.
