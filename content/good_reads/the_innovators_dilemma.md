# The fundamental premise

# The implicit choice of everything you will not do

When a company builds its internal culture, the mindset usually follows a path towards a specific objective, towards what you want to accomplish, but there is an implicit, much broader decisions that is happening at the same time, and usually outside of the view frustum of leader, the choice of everything the organization will not do, which as that wich is desired solidifies, becomes ever harder to achieve.

And it makes total sense, considering the rather voluminous list of things one gets not to do, in exchange for a handful of options that one does - it would be rather paralyzing to make decisions if one had to consider all the alternative possibilities.

# Structural flexibility



# Not just products or markets, but internal evolution

I see this same issue internally in organizations, considering the adoption of disruptive practices such as DevOps and Cloud Native.

# Clarity of vision for disruptive change

# Hypothesis of internal change

It is also stated that the level of effort in achieving effective execution of disruptive opportunities is usually lower (by orders of magnitude) when one is dealing with a new organization that is measured by and motivated with criteria that is of no interest to its larger counterpart, but how can one do that when it is an internal change? Restructure is a probable opportunity for disruption.
