_The innovator's dilemma_ by Clayton M. Christensen is another one of those books that have become obligatory reading in Silicon Valley circles.

The author looks at a handful of industries that have gone through multiple cycles of technological disruption, and attempts to identify what was it about some companies that allowed them to survive disruption, while the majority, once exposed to such dramatic change, failed to adapt and succumbed.

There were quite a few concepts exposed by Christensen that triggered my curiosity, in terms of technological evolution, regarding organizational elasticity and ability to change, and of course the controversial concept that doing the right thing might be the cause of your demise.

I deal with digital transformation. Most of my clients and the projects in which I participate are in one way or another eliciting change, evolution, in the organization.

Think of DevOps, a fundamentally cultural movement, one in which success hinges only partially (some would argue, if at all), from technological factors, but exposes the organization to a usually disruptive change in terms of processes, dialogue and mindset.

I can't help but see the commonality, and I'll attempt to elaborate on how cultural and organizational change can be sustaining or disruptive, and that regardless of whether it's about a technology product or service, or the culture of an organization, the challenges to overcome (as well as the usual pitfalls) are similar. 

# Two types of change

Christensen proposes that there are two fundamentally different types of change, two ways in which technology can develop.

- **Sustaining evolution**: These are developments that occur within an already established paradigm. They improve what already exists, and usually happens incrementally over time.

- **Disruptive evolution**: These are changes that create new markets and value networks, and eventually disrupt existing ones. They are driven by significant alterations in a product or service in ways that users did not expect.

# The implicit choice of everything you will not do

When a company builds its internal culture, the mindset usually follows a path towards a specific objective, towards what you want to accomplish, but there is an implicit, much broader decisions that is happening at the same time, and usually outside the line of sight of the leader, the choice of everything the organization will not do, which as that wich is desired solidifies, becomes ever harder to achieve.

And it makes total sense, considering the rather voluminous list of things one gets not to do, in exchange for a handful of options that one does - it would be rather paralyzing to make decisions if one had to consider all the alternative possibilities.

# Structural flexibility

# Innovators dilemma 

# Not just products or markets, but internal evolution

I see this same issue internally in organizations, considering the adoption of disruptive practices such as DevOps and Cloud Native.

# Clarity of vision for disruptive change

# Hypothesis of internal change

It is also stated that the level of effort in achieving effective execution of disruptive opportunities is usually lower (by orders of magnitude) when one is dealing with a new organization that is measured by and motivated with criteria that is of no interest to its larger counterpart, but how can one do that when it is an internal change? Restructure is a probable opportunity for disruption.
