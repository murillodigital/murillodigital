# A guidebook for the life of the founder-CEO

Most people in the technology industry know who Ben Horowitz is. Founding partner at a16z, he's been involved with most of the technology companies I'm sure you engage day to day, from Facebook to Twitter to AirBnb.

But he didn't choose the VC route by chance, he did so after living the challenging and sometimes nerve wrecking life of the founder CEO.

In [The Hard Thing About Hard Things](https://amzn.to/32l3rJ5) Ben Horowitz shares the insights you will not get in your average management book, rather the marks of his battles, guidance for making decisions when there are no perfect choices, and your life depends on it.

Having started businesses in earlier stages of my life, and looking back at entrepreneurship as I progress into new stages, I was eager to learn what one of the most renowned venture capitalists in the modern world had to say.

Most startups fail, the effort and energy one has to put in to succeed as an entrepreneur usually surpass by orders of magnitude anything a regular good job would impose on an individual, what is it that really drives people to make this almost incomprehensible choice, and how can I increase my odds of success?

> The struggle is where greatness comes from.

# A desire for greatness

So you make a choice for yourself - chase an idea, risk everything, work long hours and put your life (and the lives of others) on the line to achieve a vision that maybe, with a lot of effort and not without some luck, may just succeed.

_Are you not afraid?_

I've dedicated a good amount of introspection to answer that very question, what is it that makes some people answer "yes" and continue marching on? I think I've found the answer.

There is one thing that makes me more afraid than any of the arguments above - what I'm really afraid of is achieving just "the average", even afraid of being just "really good", when one could achieve the extraordinary - when greatness exists, "just good" is perhaps the worst form of failure.

> It taught me that being scared didn't mean I was gutless. What I did _mattered_ and would determine whether I would be a hero or a coward.



# Borderline irrational hope

Let's 

> In particularly dire circumstances when the "facts" seemed to dictate a certain outcome, I learned to look for alternative narratives and explanations coming from radically different perspectives to inform my outlook. The simple existence of an alternate, plausible scenario is often all that's needed to keep hope alive among a worried workforce.

# How to become a CEO? Be a CEO (and struggle)



# Irradiating aspiration when your team has been through it all 

> There are no shortcuts to knowledge, especially knwowledge gained from personal experience. Following conventional wisdom and relying on shortcuts can be worse than knowing nothing at all.

# Raising money

> During this time I learned the most import rule of raising money privately. Look for a market of one. You only need one investor to say yes, so it's best to ignore the other thirty who say "no".

# Decisions that define survival

> Yes, most things could still be delegated and most managers would be empowered to make decisions in their areas of expertise, but the fundamental question of whether -and _how_- Loudcloud could survive was mine and mine alone to answer.

# An innovators journey

Innovation is at the heart of technology entrepreneurship, therefore, the usual technology entrepreneur is an innovator, and it is this unique vision that will materialize unique value through technology.

> As a result, innovation requires a combination of knowledge, skill and courage.

# Now, let's get to some of the teachings

You really should get the story straight from the source, I really hope you take the time to read [The Hard Thing About Hard Things](https://amzn.to/32l3rJ5), but let me give you my personal interpretation of some of the teachings that I personally found more meaningful.

## Tell it like it is

There's an interesting catch 22 to communication: The more people trust you, the less you depend on communication to drive towards a common goal, but to get people to trust you, the more you have to communicate.

> A CEO's ability to build trust over time is often the difference between companies that execute well and companies that are chaotic.

Communication is a key trait to leadership - a concept also mentioned in [other great works on leadership]({{< ref max_de_pree_on_leadership >}}) by the way, so communicate constantly and extensively:

- Clearly communicate the why, not just the what
- Provide constant feedback, to everybody, always
- Encourage others to communicate, create a culture where people are not afraid to talk about bad news

> In any human interaction, the required amount of communication is inversely proportional to the level of trust.


## Laying people off and hiring people



## Don't lie to yourself

It takes a lot of guts to not find convenient explanations to why your company is losing battles. It's easier to make up explanations (lies) than to confront the harsh truth of mistakes.

## All you have are lead bullets

There are no silver bullets - if your company is losing traction, if your market is going to the competition, take a long hard look at your product or service because if there are fundamental flaws, no miraculous ideas will solve the problem. You will have to fix your offering.

## People come first, product second, profits third

I think this piece of wisdom has two angles to it:

1)  The quality of your people will define the success of your product or service and your eventual ability to generate profits. One of the key skills of a CEO is to select the right people for the right moment in the leadership team, and be able to determine when the moment has passed and the skills of the existing people no longer apply to that moment in the organization.

> I'd learned the hard way when hiring executives, one should follow Collin Powell's instructions and hire for strength rather than lack of weakness.

2) The ongoing development and leadership of your people should always come before anything else. Training, feedback, motivation and inspiration are primary objectives of a successful CEO.

> My old boss Jim Barksdale was fond of saying, _"We take care of the people, the products and the profits-in that order"_. It's a simple saying, but it's deep. _"Taking care of the people"_ is the most difficult of the three by far, and if you don't do it, the other two won't matter.

To the latter point, training is crucial - people are the most important asset of any technology company, and training is, in the words of Andrew Grove, former CEO of Intel, the highest leverage activity a manager can perform, and one out of two things she can do to impact employee's output.

## Becoming a good place to work matters

There's more bad companies out there than there are good companies, and a lot of pretty bad places to work still make profits.

To be clear, a good company is one where there's an empowering culture, it's a company where people truly enjoy working, where they feel they are working on a meaningful mission towards a great future. It doesn't have anything to do wih revenues or profit.

It takes a lot of effort to become a great company, and the fact that as much as being a great company has nothing to do with cash flow, you can't just focus on building a great company if you have no money flowing in, doesn't make it any simpler.

But it is the difference between life and death, because being a great company matter mostly when things are not going well - it's the difference between your team marching into battle with you, or bailing on you. And things will always go wrong at one point or another.
