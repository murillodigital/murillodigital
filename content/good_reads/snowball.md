Warren Buffett, also known as "The Oracle of Omaha", is a brilliant business man, famous for having built his fortune as an investor. He held the position of world's wealthiest man for many years and is likely the best known name when talking about long term investment. You see and read a lot about him in the news, he's referenced in virtually every article that relates to fundamental investing or the stock market, and a certain aura of humbleness and simplicity follow him.
  
I've always been fascinated with business, and consider myself an apprentice stock market investor; needless to say, Mr. Buffett's life has always been a source of admiration for me.

That curiosity led me to purchase [_Snowball_](https://amzn.to/2OJoPAg), a biographic book written by _Alice Schroeder_.

Yet the book sat unread in a little table I used for meetings in my office for years, I had actually purchased it back in March 2018. Yet, I've always strongly believed that knowledge sometimes finds you when the right time has arrived, and eludes you when you are not ready, and my encounter with Snowball, although delayed by years, finally arrived.

# The ovarian lottery

How does your family and where you were born define you? Would you be the same person and would you have achieved the same had you been born in a poorer part of the world? Had your parents neglected you or had they been more dedicated?

Nobody chose where to be born, and Buffett uses a term to describe that seemingly random occurrence: _the ovarian lottery_. I laughed when I first learned about it, yet, I can see the concept reflected in me, I can see how my life, from its very beginnings, has been framed and constrained by a set of characteristics that have driven me to where I am today.

Buffett's ovarian _number_ was lucky enough, he was  born in a time and place that enabled him to show and augment his natural tendencies and abilities from a very young age.

# A collector



# Just as human as you and me

# Paradoxical views

# Miraculous acts followed by blind faith

# The problem with time

> ... three roles invariably interested him. The first was the relentless collector, expanding his empire of money, people and influence. The second was the preacher, sprinkling idealism from the lectern. The third was the cop, foiling the bad guys.


> He helped her understand that it was always a mistake to pay too much for something you wanted. Impatience as the enemy.

warren really collects people, not stock, he picks those that manage a business, replaces them with his close network, and builds a loyal following to which he is endlessly loyal to as wlel

the stories are not quite right, the legend is skewed, but he is brilliant

hes human, maturing and evolving, thats a great lesson

it was like reading the bible, with Buffett and his partners as apostles and the investors in their partnerships following faithuflly merely guided by Buffett seemingly miraculous feats

time doesnt compound, its the one thing that you can't collect

contradictions and paradox in his views around health

errors by omission ---- the avoidance of waste
