Mr. Warren Buffett, also known as "The Oracle of Omaha", a brilliant business man and perhaps the most famous investor of all times. He held the position of world's wealthiest man for many years, and his name pervades the news and gets mentioned in virtually every book you can find that talks about the stock market. A man with an aura of humbleness and simplicity albeit being also known for his aggressiveness in negotiations and what some may identify as an obsession with money.
  
I've always been fascinated with business, and consider myself an apprentice stock market investor; needless to say, Mr. Buffett's life has always been a source of admiration and curiosity for me. That curiosity led me to purchase [_Snowball_](https://amzn.to/2OJoPAg), a biographic book written by _Alice Schroeder_.

Yet the book sat unread in my office for many months, I purchased the book back in March 2018. Call me superstitious, but I think, sometimes, books find you when the right time has arrived, and elude you when you are not ready, and my encounter with Snowball, although delayed by years, finally came.

# The ovarian lottery

How does your family and birthplace define you? Would you be the same person and would you have achieved the same had you been born in a poorer part of the world? Had your parents neglected you or had they been more dedicated? Nobody chose where to be born, and Buffett uses a term to describe this seemingly random occurrence: _the ovarian lottery_.

I laughed when I first read the words, yet, I can see the concept reflected in me: I can see how my life, from its very beginnings, has been framed, driven and at the same time constrained by a set of characteristics that surround me and have, to a (large) degree, defined who and where I am today.

Buffett's ovarian _number_ was lucky enough, he was born in a time and place that enabled him to show and augment his natural tendencies and abilities from a very young age, and having lived with a combination of family support and family hardship, he was encouraged and influenced towards his one ambition, **numbers**.

The Buffett's come from a long line of business men, entrepreneurship and a knack for money have run in the family for generations.

# A people collector

If I were asked which term I would use to describe Mr. Buffett, _collector_ would spring top of mind. His interesting in collecting is repeatedly mentioned in the book and personally, I think it's likely the core motivator to most of his behavior.

> ... three roles invariably interested him. The first was the relentless collector, expanding his empire of money, people and influence. The second was the preacher, sprinkling idealism from the lectern. The third was the cop, foiling the bad guys.

There are two collections that, from my interpretation, are hist most crucial ones: money, which is obvious to most, but perhaps to the surprise of some, his other collection is people.

Money undoubtedly the most visible, but people perhaps the most relevant, for people help him towards two imperative objectives: on the one hand his need for love and admiration, and on the other, **to make money**. I think his people collection has been perhaps the most critical factor in his ability to make money, nobody questions his uncanny ability in finding investment bargains, but those bargains many a times came with considerable problems, and it was his network of close confidants, people as faithful to him as he was loyal to them, that sprung to the rescue, replacing dysfunctional management and making tough yet strategic business decisions, which in turn made his investments successful.

# Just as human as you and me

I think Alice Schroeder does a fantastic job in portraying Mr. Buffett's life, full of strengths, weaknesses and beliefs. As you see his life unfold, how it evolves and matures over time, his mistakes as well as his successes, the fact he's just as much of a human being as you and me is evident and reassuring. It doesn't take an "oracle" to succeed in something the way Mr. Buffett has succeeded in business - it takes one key component:

> Then at dinner, Bill Gates Sr. posed the question to the whole: What factor did people feel was the most important in getting to where they'd gotten in life? And I said 'focus'. And Bill said the same thing.

**A relentless focus and drive towards one ambition**, that, to a degree, shadows other aspects of his life and leaves them underdeveloped or completely outside of his field of vision, which speaks to his own limitations as a human: our capacity is unlimited, but time and bandwidth are not. Balance is a tricky thing to achieve when one's looking for extraordinary results in one area.

# Paradoxical views

One issue I struggle with understanding, is Mr. Buffett's seemingly paradoxical view about life, which one can see in some of the advice he provides to others as well as in his relationship with his family and some of his own personal choices.

A resistance to waste, yet a completely disregarding view around experiencing nature or travel, that to me represent wasting one of the most enriching and sublime experiences of our life in this planet.

A focus on maintaining his own as well as his family's weight under control, to the point of incorporating weight in his arrangements for money with his children, while his own diet is full of sugary drinks and greasy hamburgers.

# Miraculous acts followed by blind faith

At points as I read the early stages of Mr. Buffett's rise to fame, managing money for his close friends and family, biblical stories kept coming to mind - an exceptional person, followed by a loyal group of faithful, who did not need any true understanding of the way he performed his miraculous feats, simply because of the magnitude of the experienced outcome.

And Buffett as the teacher, speaking in metaphors looking to indirectly lead his faithful following to greener pastures, with the promise of a bright future. 

# The problem with time

Compounding, the effect of time on good investments, is what has driven Mr. Buffett's success - but there is a caveat to time, for time itself is immune to the benefit of compounding onto itself. Time leaves you behind if you don't act when you should have, opportunities that present themselves once may never come back, age is the quintessential proof of that, ignore your health in your youth, and your life will be a lot harder in old age.

This issue with time is, from my perspective, the source of most of Mr. Buffett's regrets - the errors that follow him are not sourced in actions he took, rather in all those that he did not take in due time.



# A scale of business beyond imagination

Probably one of the most eye-opening insights to me from reading Mr. Buffett's fascinating life, particularly as his fame and wealth progressed, is the dimension at which global business operates. I have started companies and have worked with startups as well as Fortune 500s and have spent time with CEOs and CTOs, but it seems to me I haven't yet really been able to experience to topmost circles of power and influence. Spheres exist of extreme wealth, there is a scale of business and lifestyle beyond what most of us have the ability to explore.

The key here is that it is possible to work towards reaching that summit, and it takes a bit of ovarian lottery luck, but also a lot of hard work and *focus*, relentless, infinite focus towards an ambitious goal.


> He helped her understand that it was always a mistake to pay too much for something you wanted. Impatience as the enemy.



> Rule number one, don't lose money. Rule number two, don't forget rule number one. Rule number three, don't go in debt.

> I cried a lot when my mother died. It wasn't because I was sad and missed her. It was because of the waste. She hard her good parts, but the bad parts kept me from having a relationship with her. My dad and I never talked about it. But I really regret the waste of what could have been.

> And the truth you are neither right nor wrong because people agree with you. You're right because your facts and reasoning are right. In the end, that's what counts.

> Most of them were prominent businessmen accustomed to stress and pressure, from a generation of men that considered poise and equanimity in the face of disaster as essential as the suits and ties they wore every day to work.

> Cash combined with courage in a crisis is priceless

> The purpose of life is to be loved by as many people as possible among those you want to have love you.

it was like reading the bible, with Buffett and his partners as apostles and the investors in their partnerships following faithuflly merely guided by Buffett seemingly miraculous feats

time doesnt compound, its the one thing that you can't collect

contradictions and paradox in his views around health

errors by omission ---- the avoidance of waste
