warren really collects people, not stock, he picks those that manage a business, replaces them with his close network, and builds a loyal following to which he is endlessly loyal to as wlel

the stories are not quite right, the legend is skewed, but he is brilliant

hes human, maturing and evolving, thats a great lesson

it was like reading the bible, with Buffett and his partners as apostles and the investors in their partnerships following faithuflly merely guided by Buffett seemingly miraculous feats

time doesnt compound, its the one thing that you can't collect

contradictions and paradox in his views around health

errors by omission ---- the avoidance of waste
