## The new era of space travel is upon us

Two things definitely fascinate me: space travel and extraordinary human beings.

I was flying back from the Google Cloud Campus in Sunnyvale and bought [_How to make a spaceship_](https://amzn.to/3envQkz) by Julian Guthrie in SFO just by chance, and to my surprise I got a satisfying dose of both.

We are living in a great time in history, just a few weeks ago I saw, with huge excitement how, after many years, astronauts finally flew back into space from US soil. 

Up until that day, space travel still felt as something distant and obscure, completely out of reach, but this time, I got to sit down with my kids and see the launch with a true sense of connection, and the realization that this was a revolutionary step towards their generation eventually exploring outside the confines of our pale blue dot.

_How to make a spaceship_ tells the story of how a small group of brilliant individuals got this revolution started, dedicating huge amounts of effort and inventiveness with one clear focus: **the exploration of space**.

Many free-thinkers, visionaries and fearless, extraordinary individuals are mentioned in the book, but one person in particular stands out, [Peter Diamandis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Diamandis), a unique mind with an extraordinary vision.

**If you are looking for a shot of inspiration and encouragement to think different and, literally, shoot for the stars, you will definitely enjoy [_How to make a spaceship_](https://amzn.to/3envQkz).**
