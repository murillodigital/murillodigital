## A systematic way to improve your life and reach your goals

I'm naturally inclined to look for systems and structure whenever a problem requires a solution, that is what I do professionally every day: given an objective, find the more effective way to write an algorithm, design an architecture or lead towards reaching it as efficiently as possible.

[_The Power of Habit_](https://amzn.to/32bnbzg) by Charles Duhigg was a fascinating read that gave me two insights that have already turned out life changing.

First, **we are programmable and automated**, a particularly powerful realization for a person with my natural inclinations.

Second, this quality of our very human nature is being **constantly taken advantage of (some may even say abused) in order to manipulate and drive our behavior**.

## Gaining control of your patterns of behavior.

This knowledge becomes relatable and practical as soon as you realize that the mechanism that drives the majority of the actions you do every day can be adjusted, as long as you follow some basic rules.

It is quite empowering to understand how one can modify one's own behavior, and sniff out ways in which commerce, politics and other influences manipulate you.

Habits consist of three different components, and you can change the habit by following a relatively simple process.

### The three components of a habit

**Cue**: The trigger - a time, person, emotion.  
**Routine**: The automatic actions you perform, without much attention, when you pick up on the cue.  
**Reward**: The satisfaction you get from having completed your routine.  

## The simple rule to modify your habits

**As long as the input and the output (cue and reward) stay the same, the routine can be freely adjusted.**

Now, beware there are two caveats to the above, which are perhaps the more difficult components to incorporate when you are looking to modify some pattern, and they fall outside of the purely systematic nature of the habit.

## The human nature that defines your sustained behavior

**Faith**, you don't see this often when building systems - I'm not talking (necessarily) about God or religion, rather the undeniable belief that the routine in your habit can be successfully changed - else, you will revert to your previous state during times of stress.

**Anticipation**, our ability to savor and predict the reward as soon as you experience the cue.

We are not machines, and these last two components I mention are precisely what demonstrate that difference - a system drives our behavior, but it is our human nature what makes that system frail or powerful, depending on your own views about your humanity.

## Our humanity makes or breaks the system

**I for one, believe this human nature of ours is definitely what makes our system more powerful than any other** - can't tell you how many times I've wished intensely for a piece of code to function a given way only to have it blow up in my face.

**Faith has no impact on the effectiveness of systems, but it is a subtle force that influences what we people do.**

I'm a spiritual, not-religious man, but I think most of my faith is actually self directed, I truly believe I have the ability to change, and this book has shown me how important it is to reinforce those thoughts.

## Now its your turn

Definitely recommend you read [_The Power of Habit_](https://amzn.to/32bnbzg), find those cues and start re-programming your life, and never stop believing in whatever you choose to believe, because that is what will in the end make the real difference.
