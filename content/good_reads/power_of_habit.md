I'm naturally inclined to look for systems and structure whenever a problem requires a solution - after all this is what I do professionally every day: given an objective, find the more effective way to write an algorithm, design an architecture or lead towards reaching it as efficiently as possible.

[_The Power of Habit_](https://amzn.to/32bnbzg) by Charles Duhigg was a fascinating read that gave me two insights that have already turned out life changing.

First, **we are programmable and automated**, a particularly powerful realization for a person with my natural inclinations.  
Second, this quality of our very human nature is being constantly taken advantage of (some may even say abused) in order to manipulate and drive our behavior.

This knowledge becomes relatable and practical as soon as you realize that the algorithm that drives the majority of the actions you do every day is relatively simple and can be adjusted, as long as you follow some basic rules.

**Cue**: The input - a time, person, emotion.  
**Routine**: The body of the function.  
**Reward**: The output, the pleasing return of the function.  

And the rule is, as long as the input and the output (cue and reward) stay the same, the routine can be freely adjusted.

Now, beware there are two caveats to the above, which are perhaps the more difficult components to incorporate when you are looking to modify some pattern, and they fall outside of the purely systematic way of the habit.

**Faith**, you don't see this often when building systems - I'm not talking (necessarily) about God or religion, rather the undeniable belief that the routine in your algorithm can be successfully changed (else, the function will revert to its previous state during times of stress), and **anticipation**, savor and predict the reward as soon as you experience the cue.

We are not machines, and these last two components I mention are precisely what demonstrate that difference - a system drives our behavior, but it is our human nature what makes that system frail or powerful, depending on your own views about your humanity.

I for one, believe this human nature of ours is definitely what makes our system more powerful than any other - can't tell you how many times I've wished intensely for a piece of code to function only to have it blow up in my face, faith has no impact on the effectiveness of systems, but it is a subtle force that influences what we people do. I'm a spiritual, not-religious man, but I think most of my faith is actually self directed, I truly believe I have the ability to change, and this book has shown me how important it is to reinforce those thoughts.

Definitely recommend you read [_The Power of Habit_](https://amzn.to/32bnbzg), find those cues and start re-programming your life, and never stop believing in whatever you choose to believe, because that is what will in the end make the real difference.
