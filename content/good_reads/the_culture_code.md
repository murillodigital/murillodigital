# Culture eats strategy for breakfast

The quote above comes from _Peter Drucker_, "the founder of modern management", a brilliant thinker that left us with abundant theory on how to succeed in building and running a business.

Business, and any other human endeavor for the most part, can be reduced to a very simple pattern: "_groups of people working together_".

This basic tenet speaks volumes on the relevance of understanding and dedicating targeted effort in enabling those groups of people to efficiently work as a collective.

All teams and organizations express a culture, which accounts for the common patterns in thought and behavior the members of the group consistently perform and which represent their current state of evolution.

However, not all cultures evolve in the same way, and only a subset of those collective patterns enable the achievement of dramatically superior results and perform at a very much increased capacity than others.

In [_The Culture Code_](https://amzn.to/2GogAZF), Daniel Coyle studies this subject by looking at examples of groups that perform markedly better than others across business, academy, sports and the military. His aim is to identify the characteristics that these cultures demonstrate, and help leaders identify how they can build and influence  such highly effective cultures.

In this article I'll talk about the three core areas that leaders should focus on  developing, towards building a culture that is self-perpetuating and which drives teams onto common objectives and operating with high levels of cohesion.

Then I'll talk about my own perspective in terms of culture building, and what I consider very present challenges in the new "remote-first" world, a pattern that has gained traction in recent years, and that was solidified as the norm by the pandemic.

# Three core areas



## Skill 1: Build safety

*You are safe here*

It is safe to fail, you are not alone and we're in this together. Create connection. We are wired to look for safety in groups.

The objective is to create conditions that communicate a clear message of "togetherness".

> Cohesion happens not when members of a group are smarter but when they are lit up by clear, steady signals of safe connection.


People are moved to do more if they know somebody's got their backs, and they will not be reckeless when they know others are just as dependent on them.

Building a culture of safety requires cues delivered consistently and over time, its a narrative that must be ever present.

### How does one build belonging

Closeness and connection, and problem solving together. Nothing builds cohesion in a group like having to solve problems and struggle, together. And the leader should be candid, direct yet present and caring for her team.

> One misconception about highly successful cultures is that they are happy, lighthearted places. This is mostly not the case. They are energized and engaged, but at their core their members are oriented less around achieving happiness than around solving hard problems together.

A leader should provide perspective, a big picture view of the world, and establish connection outside the tasks at hand, relationships are built both in and around the professional development of the team.

### Designing for belonging

In the words of Tony Hsieh, Zappos founder, create environments and model interactions that bring forth many opportunities for meaningful "collisions". Collisions are instances where people can bump into one another.

An experiment performed by the US during the cold war to evaluate why some teams succeeded and others did not in research and development of new technologies and weapons demonstrated something surprising, the one consistent difference across between successful teams vs those that were not, was the distance at which they sat. Closer means more communication, and more communication means a stronger sense of belonging and more ideas. This concept is known as the [Allen Curve]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_curve)


## Skill 2: Share Vulnerability

Belonging is about cohesion, but that is not enough to produce outstanding performance. That cohesion must be transformed into actual actions that result in remarkable performance.

Vulnerability is the key component that, once you have a team where everybody has a clear sense of belonging and safety, triggers the drive that results in outstanding performance.

Every one of the cultures studied in [_The Culture Code_](https://amzn.to/2GogAZF) promote moments of intense vulnerability:

- Pixar uses BrainTrust meetings, meetings where movies get assessed and critiqued.
- SEAL teams use After-Action Reviews, events that take place within the team immediately after a mission to evalaute what worked and what did not.

Leaders should clearly signal their own vulnerability. These signals of vulnerability creates a virtuous cycle where each signal promotes others to also express their own signals, and in every iteration, increase the closeness and trust of the group.

> The story of the Red Balloon Challenges strikes us as surprising, because most of us instinctively see vulnerability as a condition to be hidden. But science shows that when it comes to creating cooperation, vulnerability is nto a risk but a psychological requirement.

The other aspect of enabling cooperation and sharing vulnerability is providing teams with the autonomy to cooperate, to think for themselves.

Being vulnerable together allows teams to challenge each other, and trust each other as equals. This goes against the norm of deferring to some authority. The leader should generate a series of signals that influence the team away from the natural tendency of following authority mandates, and into new tendencies for interdependence and cooperation.

Finally, to truly connect with every individual in your team or organization, leaders must master the skill of listening and asking questions. Your role is to discover, empathize and engage.

> ... the most important moments in conversation happen when one person is actively, intently listening.

## Skill 3: Establish purpose

The last piece of the puzzle, after having built a safe environment, where people feel they belong and can share the risk and vulnerability, is to answer the question: _What are we working towards?_.

Defining a mission is not subtle amongst the studied high performing groups, the beliefs and mission that define purpose are ever present across all facilities, interactions and communications.

And they are reinforced in the daily discourse using recurring statements and signals. Cultures that are exceptionally performant constantly build, tell and retell their story.

But the past is not enough, successful cultures link the past with a future ideal.

Purpose is also established by associating meaning to the actions of the team, providing a vision of how their efforts affect and impact a grander objective.

To establish purpose, the environment must constantly produce an ongoing stream of clear signals aligned to this shared goal. It's less about inspiration and more about consistency.

# Developing for proficiency and creativity require different approaches

Most teams will require a combination of both proficiency (doing a task with extreme reliability every time where the goal behaviors can be clearly defined), and creativity (building something that has never existed before). Each of these two different types of development require different mechanisms to promote excellence.

When developing for proficiency you want to train using high-repetitions and high-feedback, honoring the fundamentals of the skill by constantly demonstrating models of excellence. Another important aspect when developing for proficiency is the need to build and reinforce vivid rules of thumb.

On the other hand, the actions a leader must take in order to build a culture skilled in creativity should focus on the team composition and dynamics, the team's autonomy and the team's tolerance and acceptance to failure and feedback. The leader should encourage initiative and establish routines of celebration when team members demonstrate independence and candidness.



# The impact of remote work in culture



A lot of the characteristics in terms of behavior from teams that demonstrate strong cohesiveness and an environment that is safe and full of trust are dependent on physical proximity.

Touch, eye contact, lots of energetic and unstructured exchanges. What does this mean in the context of remote team work?

# Some numbers that demonstrate the importance

> A strong culture increases net income 756 percent over eleven years, according to a Harvard study of more than two hundred companies.

> To work at Google was to enter a giant, continuous wrestling match in which no person was considered above the fray
