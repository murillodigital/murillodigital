I work with large enterprises day in and day out. RFPs, MSAs, SOWs and working with competing professional service organizations and vendors as well as with the client's globally dispersed and culturally heterogeneous teams, are ever present components of the engagements in which I participate regularly in my role as solutions architect and while leading engineering teams.

And I must admit, there's frustration in many of those experiences, a usual aftertaste of a broken system - processes and structures that do not enable true innovation nor engineering quality, that inhibit the growth of companies and the teams that make them run.

The promise of **true** transformation still eludes many, many enterprises, and the catch phrases of DevOps, Agile and Lean, now present in some shape or form in everybodyÂ´s discourse, seem to get frequently mutated into convenient shapes that don't quite live up to their audacious goal, but that do check a box in the strategy of the IT organization.

This may sound harsh, nevertheless, you can count on it being honest - and I think honesty is the first step. Self awareness is key to enlightenment.

Yes, I know this opinion, in the year 2020, might be controversial... I mean, "look at the following benchmark and industry survey" right? Didn't I read somewhere that agile is the new norm and that 85% of the respondents have adopted DevOps?

From my perspective, those numbers are dramatically skewed by interpretation, dig deep, and you will see that those 85% adopters have a partial understanding of the all-encompassing paradigm shift that is a truly agile enterprise and are not really nor fully supported by their organization - they may be doing some form of CI/CD and very likely using the cloud, they're doing standups and have nice Jira boards; but the way the organization budgets, the areas where investment is focused and the mechanisms by which those investments are assigned, executed and evaluated; and the structures that drive strategy, enable experimentation and promote collaboration still have a long way to go.

# Confirmation, and a path forward

One good thing is, it's not just me that has had the above experience. In _[Lean Enterprise](https://amzn.to/30aQNuZ)_ the authors narrate, with uncanny resemblance to field stories of my own, scenarios that resonate with those very problems. Although five years have passed since its first edition, a lot of the foundational problems that lean and agile look to solve are still deep-rooted in most enterprises I encounter.

The other good thing is _[Lean Enterprise](https://amzn.to/30aQNuZ)_ shows you that **paths forward exist** (*Lean being one of them*);  there are ways to truly transform and enable creativity, ingenuity and innovation to flourish in the enterprise. Who wouldn't want that to happen? Imagine if the ability to revolutionize and disrupt of startups scrambling for funding could be achieved by billion dollar companies - how much faster could society advance?

# A (very) high level map

However, what you will get from reading this book, is a very high level map - a huge reading list to follow up on.

The book touches on a large body of very relevant topics and strategies but keeps at the very surface of those highly intricate subjects. This will be definitely a stepping stone for the reader, but the real homework will lie ahead.

# Key takeaways

Let me share with you a few of the key takeaways I got after reading _[Lean Enterprise](https://amzn.to/30aQNuZ)_:

- **There is hope.** It is not utopia, enterprises can and have transformed integrally and have enabled true innovation, not just technically but also in the ways they engage their partners, vendors and teams, and the way they approach their finances and product horizons.

- **There is knowledge.** You are not alone in this endeavour and there are huge amounts of acquired expertise, theories and success and failure stories from others that have walked a very similar path as the one you are likely on considering you have picked up or will pick up this book.

- **Real change is integral, and C level championship is indispensable.** Transformation is **not** a technical exercise, its an integral business exercise that is empowered by technology as a constructive tool, but it would work just as well if you were using it for handcrafts. However, being integral, true transformation involves executive strategy, finances, project management, recruitment and talent management, and basically every aspect of the operation of an enterprise. The higher up you can get in the decision making organization, the better your changes of *truly* achieving your audacious objectives.
