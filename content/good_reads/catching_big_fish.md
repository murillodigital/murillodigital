To be quite honest, the name David Lynch is one that merely rang a bell, I wasn't too familiar with any of his films, and the closest I had gotten to his work was out of a recommendation from an old friend in a previous life to watch Twin Peaks.

I've been meditating for quite some time - if you follow me or know me closely you likely have already and repeatedly heard my thoughts on mindfulness and meditation as indispensable components towards realizing one's own potential. Through meditation I have overcome weaknesses, found focus and in many ways _awakened_.

Why these two, seemingly unrelated comments? Well, a few months ago, somebody on my LinkedIn network who's also an avid reader shared a photo of some new book he had just gotten, and amongst them was _Catching big fish_. I was instantly drawn by its description: _meditation, consciousness and creativity_.
